# ECE387-final

# For final projectï¼Œ my plan is to connect the Arduino Uno to ISD 1820.  ISD1820 Voice Recorder Module will record and play sound. Potentiometer connects between ISD1820 and speaker, which can adjust the volume by turning button. On the other side, the LED is connected to the UNO through a resistor. The blinking of the led is determined by controlling the sound level. I will write code on Arduino IDE
